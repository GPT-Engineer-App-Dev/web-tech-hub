# web-tech-hub

Implement a landing page for a marketplace called Particles that connects companies with software talent. The page should explain the key value propositions:

- Access to top developers specializing in web technologies 
- Ability to search and filter developers by technology
- Direct messaging to reach out to developers

Use a modern, professional design with a tech-focused color scheme. Include relevant imagery related to software development.

The main call-to-action should be a button labeled "View Developer Listings" which links to a /developers page (which will be implemented separately).
